lesson06: Unit Testing and Advanced Argument Passing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The optional, ungraded activities are called 'Exercises' in the lesson06 content so they are in the Exercises folder. 
There are no graded exercises in this lesson.

The assignment is a further extension of the donation mailing application. This version involves refactoring to
separate out the UI code and writing unit tests to test all of the rest of the code using pytest. Notably, test-driven
development - a technique where tests are written first and the code is then written to satisfy the tests - is
introduced in this lesson.
