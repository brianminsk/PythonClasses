PY210 Programming in Python
===========================
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
My work for the University of Washington's Certificate in Python Programming
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

This course is broken down into 10 lessons:

1. **Setting Up Your Environment**
2. **Basic Python and Functions**
3. **Booleans, Sequences, Iteration, and Strings**
4. **Dictionaries, Sets and Files**
5. **Exceptions and Modules**
6. **Unit Testing and Advanced Argument Passing** 
7. **Intro to Object Oriented Programing**
8. **Properties and Magic Methods**
9. **Advanced Object Oriented Programming**
10. **Introduction to Functional Programming**

Coding work for each lesson might consist of:

- **Activities** (ungraded practice experiences, often from the `CodingBat <https://codingbat.com/python>`_ site),
- **Exercises** (graded 'low stakes' practice experiences), and
- **Assignments** (graded 'high value' evidence of competence).

Each lesson in the repository tends to have this structure, though some of the lesson's activities are named 'CodingBat'.

In general, most of the work was done from scratch, with code copied from the lesson content occasionally. We forked from a central class repository on GitHub and 
when we were ready to turn in work we pushed it from our forked repository, and made a pull request back to the main repository for instructory review.

There was no work assigned for Lesson 10 - that's why there is no lesson10 folder in the repository.
