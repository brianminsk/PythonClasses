Again, there are a bunch of small `CodingBat <https://codingbat.com/python>`_ 'warmup' activities. There are also 3 
graded exercises. 

There is also the first 'assignment' (graded 'high value' evidence of competence) which you can see in the `Assignment 
<https://github.com/brianminsk/PythonClasses/tree/master/UW_Python210_Programming_In_Python/lesson03/Assignment>`_ folder.
This assignment is part of a donation tracking application that sends emails to donors and is extended in 3 additional
lessons: lessons 4-6.
