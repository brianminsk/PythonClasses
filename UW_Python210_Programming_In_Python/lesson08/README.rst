lesson08: Properties and Magic Methods
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The activity is to create a SparseArray class (a data structure where zero values are not stored) that emulates a Python list.

The assignment is to write a Circle class that has various properties, methods, and operators and to subclass Circle to 
make a Sphere class. 

I am not sure why but my documentation is sparse for the code in this lesson...
