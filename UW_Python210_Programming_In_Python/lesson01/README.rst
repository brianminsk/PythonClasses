lesson01: Setting Up Your Environment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Most of this lesson consisted of things like setting up Python, git, and a code editor, working with the class GitHub
repository and such. But there were also some short, easy 'warmup' activities from the 
`CodingBat <https://codingbat.com/python>`_ site, which are short problems that require a handful of code lines to 
solve. If you go to that site you can see how the file names of my code match up with the problems there.

I didn't bother to document my code since they were very short, ungraded assignments.
