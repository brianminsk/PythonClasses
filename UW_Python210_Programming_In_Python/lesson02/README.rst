lesson02: Basic Python and Functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

As with lesson01 there were a bunch of small `CodingBat <https://codingbat.com/python>`_ 'warmup' activities which I 
didn't bother to document. 

We also had our first graded exercises which you can see in the `Exercises 
<https://github.com/brianminsk/PythonClasses/tree/master/UW_Python210_Programming_In_Python/lesson02/Exercises>`_ folder.
In those files you can see how I document my code. Also in series.py you can see some rudimentary tests. I think these
exercises would be quite challenging for someone with no programming experience. In particular, series.py consists of
Fibonacci and Fibonacci-like series, typically implemented recursively (recursion would be taught later on).
