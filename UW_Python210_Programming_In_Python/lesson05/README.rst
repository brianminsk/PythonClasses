lesson05: Exceptions and Modules
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The ungraded activity this week has us doing some comprehension tasks (I am not sure why comprehensions were included in a lesson
about exceptions and modules but they were...). The graded exercise concerns exceptions and the graded assignment is
yet another continuation of the donor mailing application started in lesson03.
