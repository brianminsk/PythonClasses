My Work for the University of Washington's Python Programming Certification
===========================================================================

This repository contains my coursework for the University of Washington's `Certificate in Python Programming
<https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/python-programming/>`_ that I completed 2019-2020.

I received 100% grade in all coursework.

There are three courses in the certificate:

- PY210: `Programming in Python <https://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/programming-in-python>`_ ,
- PY220: `Advanced Programming in Python <https://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/advanced-programming-in-python>`_ , and 
- PY230: `Internet Programming in Python <https://www.pce.uw.edu/courses/internet-programming-with-python>`_ .

Since I did not live near Seattle when I was completing the courses and I wanted to start the courses immediately I used the '`online, self-paced <https://www.pce.uw.edu/help/selecting-a-program/learning-formats#selfpaced>`_'
learning format. The learning format for these courses consisted of reading material, videos of the instructors, discussion forums, and links to external text and video content. Each course also had one or two instructors to whom you could ask questions and who also graded our work.

The repository has 3 top-level folders:

- |folder| `UW_Python210_Programming_In_Python <https://github.com/brianminsk/PythonClasses/tree/master/UW_Python210_Programming_In_Python>`_ ,
- |folder| `UW_Python220_Advanced_Programming_In_Python <https://github.com/brianminsk/PythonClasses/tree/master/UW_Python220_Advanced_Programming_In_Python>`_ , and 
- |folder| `UW_Python230_Internet_Programming_In_Python <https://github.com/brianminsk/PythonClasses/tree/master/UW_Python230_Internet_Programming_In_Python>`_ .
