My work for the University of Washington's Certificate in Python Programming
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

This course is broken down into 5 parts and 10 lessons:

* **Part 1 - Flask** 

  1. Web Frameworks & Flask 
* **Part 2 - Internet Technologies**

  2. TCP/IP & Sockets
  3. Web Protocols
  4. CGI & WSGI
* **Part 3 - Consuming the Web** 

  5. Mashups & Microservices
  6. Using APIs & Getting Started with Django
* **Part 4 - Django**

  7. Django Continued
  8. Django Addons & Security
  9. Django Deployment
* **Part 5 - The Internet of Things**

  10. Metaprogramming

Coding work for each lesson might consist of:

- **Activities** (ungraded practice experiences) and
- **Assignments** (graded evidence of competence).

Each lesson in the repository tends to have this structure, though lessons 4 through 8 and 10 did not have activities.

Unlike the first two courses in the Python Programming certificate sequence it was more typical that we forked already written code from individual repositories for each
activity or assignment - or copied code from the online materials - and added to and altered this code.
