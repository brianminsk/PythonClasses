I am originally from Atlanta, Georgia then moved to Woodinville, Washington,
where I lived for 12 years. My home is now way out in the country in Chiang
Mai province of Thailand very close to the border with Myanmar. I am
temporarily back in Washington state, near Silverdale, and plan to return
home to Thailand later this year.

My largest software development project was the Windows text mining tool,
VantagePoint, which was coded almost entirely by me and one other developer
using Visual C++. We starting developing it around 1996. VantagePoint is still
actively developed and is used by many Global 100 organizations. It has also
been rebranded by Thomson Reuters and their spinoff, Clarivate Analytics.

I will use the Python skills I learn, as well as other skills such as web
programming, JavaScript, and PHP, to support my freelance software development
work from Thailand.
