PY220 Advanced Programming in Python
====================================
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
My work for the University of Washington's Certificate in Python Programming
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

This course is broken down into 10 lessons:

1. **Advanced Testing**
2. **Logging & Debugging**
3. **Relational Databases**
4. **Iteration**
5. **Consuming APIs with NoSQL**
6. **Profiling & Performance** 
7. **Concurrency & Async Programming**
8. **Functional Techniques**
9. **Advanced Language Constructs**
10. **Metaprogramming**

Coding work for each lesson might consist of:

- **Activities** (ungraded practice experiences) and
- **Assignments** (graded evidence of competence).

Each lesson in the repository tends to have this structure, though lessons 4 through 8 and 10 did not have activities.

In general, most of the work was done from scratch, with code copied from the lesson content occasionally. We forked from a central class repository on GitHub and 
when we were ready to turn in work we pushed it from our forked repository, and made a pull request back to the main repository for instructory review.
